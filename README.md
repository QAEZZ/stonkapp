Decided to check-out Svelte by making a simple app that shows data about a stock. \
I expect to be done by the end of the week.

CSS is in rough shape, too lazy to make it scale well for longer names.

### Final Conclusions

Svelte is interesting... I don't think this project let Svelte really shine in what it really does. \
So far I prefer Solid over Svelte.
